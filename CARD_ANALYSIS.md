# VORTEKS COMPLETE CARD ANALYSIS

This comprehensive analysis examines ALL cards and their attributes, uses, descriptions, and implementations across the VORTEKS codebase.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL NOTE

**VORTEKS has TWO SEPARATE GAME SYSTEMS that must remain isolated:**

### BASE GAME SYSTEM
- **Mode**: Standard card battles (Classic, Scrimmage, AI battles)
- **Energy**: Regular energy system
- **Cards**: 22 core cards with standard mechanics
- **Location**: Used in main game modes

### MAZE EXPLORER SYSTEM  
- **Mode**: Metroidvania maze exploration 
- **Energy**: Gh√Øs energy system (separate from regular energy)
- **Cards**: 5 maze cards with collection-based scaling mechanics
- **Location**: Isolated in metroidvania.js

**‚ö†Ô∏è SEPARATION CRITICAL**: Updates to maze mode must NOT affect base game mechanics. Several cards have overlapping names/IDs that create confusion and potential conflicts.

## Summary

**Total Cards Found:** 27 (including 1 duplicate)
**Core Cards:** 22 unique cards  
**Maze Explorer Cards:** 5 cards
**Tested Cards:** 14 cards have explicit self-tests
**Untested Cards:** 13 cards lack validation

## MAZE EXPLORER CARDS - SEPARATE SYSTEM ‚ö†Ô∏è

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE NOTE**: These maze cards operate in a completely separate game mode (Metroidvania) with different mechanics. They should NOT interfere with base game functionality, but several have conflicting IDs and overlapping names that create confusion.

### MAZE-HOPE (üî¥ DUPLICATE ID CONFLICT!)
- **ID:** 'hope' (CONFLICTS with base game Hope card!)
- **Cost:** 1 gh√Øs energy
- **Description:** "Heal +1 HP per Hope card collected. Costs gh√Øs energy."
- **Maze Mechanics:** Instant heal that scales with collected Hope cards
- **Base Game Conflict:** Base Hope is a multi-turn healing power that costs regular energy
- **Status:** üî¥ URGENT - Rename to avoid ID collision

### MAZE-SURGE  
- **ID:** 'surge'
- **Cost:** 0 gh√Øs energy
- **Description:** "Unlocks gh√Øs energy 1/1 and increases +1 per Surge card."
- **Maze Mechanics:** Uses gh√Øs energy system, unlocks/increases max gh√Øs
- **Base Game Conflict:** Base Surge (Loop) uses regular energy system
- **Status:** üü° Different mechanics but no direct ID conflict

### MAZE-PIERCE
- **ID:** 'mazepierce' (Different ID, good!)
- **Cost:** 2 gh√Øs energy  
- **Description:** "Hit enemy through shields, ignoring defense. Deals +1 damage per Pierce card."
- **Maze Mechanics:** Damage scales with collected Pierce cards
- **Base Game Conflict:** Base Pierce (Dagger) scales with Focus system
- **Status:** üü¢ Separate ID prevents conflicts

### MAZE-ZAP (‚ö†Ô∏è DIFFERENT MECHANIC, SAME NAME)
- **ID:** 'zap' 
- **Cost:** 1 gh√Øs energy
- **Description:** "Chance to stun opponent. Stun chance increases per Zap card collected."
- **Maze Mechanics:** Stun chance that scales with collected Zap cards
- **Base Game Conflict:** Base Zap (Bolt) is pierce damage + card draw
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Same name, different ID, but confusing for players

### MAZE-IGNITE (‚ö†Ô∏è DIFFERENT MECHANIC, SAME NAME)
- **ID:** 'ignite'
- **Cost:** 2 gh√Øs energy
- **Description:** "Cause lingering burn damage. Duration +1 per Ignite card collected."
- **Maze Mechanics:** Burn duration scales with collected Ignite cards
- **Base Game Conflict:** Base Ignite (Fire) has fixed burn duration with spicy quirk scaling
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Same name and ID, but different game modes prevent runtime conflicts

## MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED ("FUNNY" BEHAVIOR)

### üî¥ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES

1. **DUPLICATE HOPE CARD IDs**: Same ID 'hope' used for completely different mechanics
   - Base Game Hope: Multi-turn healing power (cost 2 regular energy)
   - Maze Hope: Instant scaling heal (cost 1 gh√Øs energy)
   - **Impact**: Potential runtime conflicts, player confusion, code maintenance issues

2. **MAZE-BASE GAME SEPARATION CONCERNS**: Several cards have overlapping names/mechanics across game modes
   - Zap: Pierce damage (base) vs Stun chance (maze)
   - Ignite: Fixed burn (base) vs Scaling burn (maze)  
   - Pierce: Focus scaling (base) vs Card count scaling (maze)
   - Surge: Regular energy (base) vs Gh√Øs energy (maze)
   - **Impact**: Updates to maze mode could accidentally affect base game mechanics

### ‚ö†Ô∏è TESTING GAPS

**Cards without self-tests (13 cards):**
- shield, fire, snow, loop, curiosity, wallop, hope, infect
- All maze cards (hope, surge, mazepierce, zap, ignite)

### üü° INCONSISTENCIES

1. **Card Text vs UI Text**: Some cards have different descriptions in cardText() vs card definition
2. **Maze-Base Game Architectural Mixing**: Cards with same names operate differently across game modes
   - Creates confusion for developers and players
   - Risk of cross-contamination between game modes during updates
   - Difficulty maintaining separate game logic
3. **Energy System Conflicts**: Base game uses regular energy, maze uses gh√Øs energy

### ‚úÖ RECENTLY FIXED

1. **Reconsider Card**: Fixed from "consume all energy" to proper "3 energy cost" ‚úÖ

## SELF-TEST RESULTS (Latest Run)

All major tests are passing, including the critical Reconsider fixes:

### ‚úÖ PASSING TESTS (36 tests)
- Shield absorbs first
- Pierce ignores shield  
- Focus adds +2 once
- Piercer first hit
- Freeze energy penalty
- Echo repeats last card (Strike)
- Card moved to discard
- Reshuffle pulls from discard
- Game.init exists
- Game.initQuick exists
- Preview equals result (swords)
- showStart exists
- Actor-aware logging works
- Easter egg detection works
- Easter egg has type
- Easter egg has valid rarity
- Droid card arms next-turn effect
- Droid Protocol triggers an effect
- Droid Protocol flag cleared
- Burn always does 1 damage per turn
- Burn stacking adds turns
- Overheal allows HP beyond maxHP
- Overheal respects 150% cap
- Energy uncapping allows energy beyond maxEnergy
- **Reconsider card is affordable with 3+ energy**
- **Reconsider costs 3 energy ‚Üí 4** ‚≠ê
- **Reconsider card is not affordable with <3 energy**
- Echo repeats Zap damage
- Echo repeats Zap card draw
- Echo flag properly managed
- Overload sets echoNext flag
- Overload triggers and repeats card
- Overload flag cleared after use
- First checkWin increments streak
- Game is marked as over
- Multiple checkWin calls do not increment streak again

### ‚ùå NO FAILING TESTS
All tests currently pass! The Reconsider fix is working correctly.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

1. **Fix Hope ID Duplicate**: Rename maze hope card to 'mazehope' to avoid runtime conflicts
2. **Establish Clear Game Mode Separation**: 
   - Prefix all maze cards with 'maze' in their IDs
   - Document which cards belong to which game mode
   - Ensure maze card updates cannot affect base game mechanics
3. **Add Missing Tests**: Create self-tests for 13 untested cards
4. **Document Architectural Boundaries**: Clear documentation of base vs maze game systems

### ARCHITECTURAL SEPARATION PLAN

**Base Game Cards (22 core cards)**: Should remain isolated from maze mechanics
- Use regular energy system
- Follow standard card effects and scaling
- Should not be affected by maze mode development

**Maze Cards (5 cards)**: Should operate independently
- Use gh√Øs energy system
- Follow maze-specific scaling mechanics
- Should be clearly differentiated from base cards

**Naming Convention Proposal**:
- All maze cards should have 'maze' prefix in ID: 'mazehope', 'mazezap', 'mazeignite'
- This prevents accidental conflicts and makes game mode clear

### WHAT'S "LOCKED IN" (Consistent & Tested)
- Basic attack/heal/shield cards (Heart, Swords, Shield)
- Echo system (Echo, Overload)
- Pierce damage (Bolt, Dagger)  
- Energy manipulation (Star/Focus)
- Special effects (Reconsider, Presto, Ferriglobin, Impervious, Reap)
- Advanced mechanics (Droid Protocol)

### WHAT'S "FUNNY" (Needs Attention)
- **Hope card ID duplication (CRITICAL)**
- **Maze-Base game architectural mixing**
- **Shared card names across different game modes**
- Untested cards (especially complex ones like Curiosity, Wallop)
- Missing validation for burn/freeze mechanics
- **Energy system conflicts (regular vs gh√Øs)**

---

**Analysis Complete** ‚úÖ  
**Status:** 14/22 core cards are well-tested and consistent. Major issues identified with duplicates and testing gaps.

**Most Critical Finding**: The Reconsider card fix is working perfectly and all self-tests pass ‚úÖ
