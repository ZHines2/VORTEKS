## 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

### Streak System Fix
- **Issue**: Potential for multiple streak increments per battle
- **Root Cause**: checkWin() could be called multiple times before game state reset
- **Solution**: Added `if (this.over) return;` guard in checkWin() method
- **Testing**: Added dedicated test cases for streak behavior
- **Verification**: All tests pass, streak now properly increments once per win

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Added Test Coverage**: New streak mechanism tests ensure reliability
- **Protected Against Edge Cases**: Multiple checkWin() calls now handled safely
- **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

## 📋 TODO Investigation Results

### Outstanding TODOs Analysis
1. **Deck Builder Enhancement** (Line 18, src/deck-builder.js)
   - **Type**: Future enhancement idea
   - **Description**: Show locked cards grayed out with unlock requirements
   - **Priority**: Low - cosmetic improvement for progression visibility
   - **Recommendation**: Keep as future enhancement, not critical

2. **Card Unlock API** (Line 571, src/card-unlock.js)  
   - **Type**: Architecture note
   - **Description**: Expose richer API for dedicated Unlocks UI panel
   - **Priority**: Low - code organization improvement
   - **Recommendation**: Keep as future enhancement, current API sufficient

**Assessment**: Both TODOs are legitimate future enhancement ideas, not bugs or critical issues requiring immediate attention.

## 🗑️ Code Cleanup Assessment  

### Dead Code Analysis
- **No unused exports found**: All exported functions are properly imported and used
- **Console statements**: All console.log/warn statements are legitimate error handling
- **No commented-out code**: No dead code blocks found
- **No deprecated functions**: All functions are active and serving purposes

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Function Usage**: All exported functions have verified usage
- **Import/Export Balance**: Clean module boundaries with no orphaned exports
- **Error Handling**: Appropriate console warnings for edge cases
- **Memory Management**: No memory leaks or resource leaks detected

## 🔍 Potential Areas for Monitoring

### Low Priority Observations
- **Font Loading**: External Google Fonts blocked in some environments (cosmetic only)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Could benefit from touch-specific enhancements
- **Accessibility**: Could expand screen reader support for card descriptions
- **Performance**: Large battles with many status effects might benefit from optimization

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
- **Card Pool**: Ready for expansion beyond current 13 cards
- **Persona System**: Architecture supports additional AI personalities  
- **Visual Effects**: Foundation exists for particle effects and animations
- **Social Features**: Local storage system could extend to multiplayer data
