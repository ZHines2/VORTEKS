2. Choose **QUICK START** for immediate action or **BUILD DECK** for customization
3. Select a quirk that matches your playstyle
4. Use energy (⚡) to play cards strategically
5. Balance offense, defense, and card draw to defeat AI opponents
6. Build win streaks to unlock advanced cards and quirks

- **Burn Tactics**: Apply damage-over-time for consistent pressure

## 🚀 Technical Features

### Modern Architecture
- **ES6 Modules**: Clean separation of concerns, no build step required
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Zero dependencies, fast loading, future-proof
- **localStorage Integration**: Persistent unlocks, settings, and progress
- **Event-Driven Design**: Extensible systems for cards, achievements, and UI

### Performance
- **Lightweight**: ~4MB total (mostly music and logo), sub-second load times
- **Memory Efficient**: Smart object pooling and cleanup
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes and devices

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Browser Play (Recommended)
```bash
# Option 1: Direct file opening
open index.html

# Option 2: Local server (for full functionality)
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080
```

### Development
```bash
# No build step needed - edit files directly
# All source files are in src/
# Styles in styles/main.css
# Data in data/ directory
```

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging

The game includes a comprehensive self-test suite accessible via the **DEBUG** button on the start screen. All 34 tests validate:

- Core game mechanics (energy, health, shields)
- Card interactions and edge cases
- AI behavior and deck building
- Unlock system functionality
- State management and persistence

## 📡 JSONBin: Local Testing

The game supports JSONBin.io for global leaderboard functionality. To test locally:

### Setup JSONBin Account
1. Sign up for a free account at [jsonbin.io](https://jsonbin.io)
2. Create a new private bin in your dashboard
3. Copy your BIN_ID from the bin URL (e.g., `https://jsonbin.io/12345abcd` → BIN_ID is `12345abcd`)
4. Get your MASTER_KEY from the API Keys section

### Local Testing Configuration
**Option 1: Browser Console (Quick Testing)**
```javascript
// Set these in your browser console before playing:
window.JSONBIN_BIN_ID = 'your-bin-id-here';
window.JSONBIN_MASTER_KEY = 'your-master-key-here';

// Then initialize the leaderboard:
initializeLeaderboard();
```

**Option 2: Runtime Configuration**
```javascript
// Configure via the helper function:
configureJSONBin({
  binId: 'your-bin-id-here',
  masterKey: 'your-master-key-here'
});

// Initialize the leaderboard:
initializeLeaderboard();
```

### Testing Steps
1. Configure JSONBin credentials as shown above
2. Set up a player profile with nickname and enable stat sharing
3. Play some games to generate analytics data
4. Test the leaderboard functions:
   ```javascript
   // Submit current stats to leaderboard
   submitToLeaderboard(getAnalytics());
   
   // Sync with JSONBin
   syncLeaderboard();
   ```
5. Open the game in another browser/incognito window with the same BIN_ID to verify cross-browser functionality

### Security Notes
- **Never commit your MASTER_KEY to version control**
- For production deployment, implement a serverless proxy (Vercel, Netlify Functions, etc.) to handle JSONBin authentication server-side
- Move data validation and sanitization to the server side for production use
- Consider rate limiting and abuse protection for production deployments

### Fallback Behavior
- If JSONBin is not configured, the game automatically falls back to localStorage-only mode
- All existing functionality continues to work without JSONBin
- Players can still use local leaderboards and profile features
